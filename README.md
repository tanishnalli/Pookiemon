**Game Title:** Pookiémon Fire Red

## Game Proposal ##

We're developing a game inspired by Pokémon FireRed, where players explore the Kanto region capturing and
training Pokémon, but with simplified mechanics to focus on strategy and adventure, including unique obstacles
like elemental terrains, hidden paths, and non-battle encounters with NPCs and wild Pookiémon.

Game Controls:

+ Arrow Keys move the main character and help swap between options in battle scenarios
+ A to confirm a choice, check things, or chat
+ B to exit, cancel a choice, or exit a mode

Game Elements:

+ Cant walk over objects such as trees, signs, fences, etc
+ Chance of Pookiemon spawning if in tall grass and moving
+ 4 options in battle mode
	+ Fight: 4 moves, different for each Pookiemon, that deal damage to opposing Pookiemon
	+ Bag: This lets you shuffle through all your current belongings
 	+ Pookiemon: This lets you view all your currently owned Pookiemon
  	+ Run: This lets you escape the battle and proceed to safety
+ Each Pookiemon has its own HP, Level, and Damage values used in battles
+ When a Pookiemon loses all its HP in battle, the player must go to the Pookiemon center to revive and heal the Pookiemon
+ The Player can alternately buy potions, and other items, from the Pookie mart to heal their Pookiemon

How to Win:

+ Beat Brock, the final boss, in Pookiémon City

## Class Design and Brainstorm ##
Make 2 Towns <br/>
1 Gym Battles, with Brock <br/>
11 Pokémon in Total <br/>
You become the champion once you beat Brock, the final boss, and the game ends. <br/>
After beating the game, players can explore the land and do as they wish. <br/>
